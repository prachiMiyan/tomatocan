Major points:
- Start livestream in Jitsi is a seperate function from Start livestream on our site. We may need to change naming convention OR change a private install of Jitsi.
- Need way to navigate between all parts of call
	- Starting, ending, then restarting a call from same page
	- Moving from CPTV stream to YouTube stream
- If we want to avoid having a handler for every stream, we need clear written directions delivered as a help section or a walkthrough.
	- What to do before meeting
		- Sign up for YouTube streaming at least 24 hours before stream to get stream key
		- Give link to viewers
		- Give link or phone number and code to co-hosts/guests
	- What to do to start meeting
		- Click Start livestream button--this should literally start the livestream, misleading
		- Choose start livestream in Jitsi, and connect Google account or type in key
		- Can we add a pre-prep time for the host?
	- What to do after meeting
		- Kick all participants (Can this be done automatically? Is there an admin role for rooms?)
		- Hang up
		- Navigate to YouTube Streaming
		- Unlist video if you want to edit and reupload
- Voice-only is way more popular than I thought. The dial-out option should be disabled as its confusing.
- Home is a splash page, and shouldn't be usable. WHAT HAS IT BECOME

Getting online
- Home > Login/Signup
- Start stream to start recording
- Invite people, added by phone number
- Audio problems, ended stream
- Had to exit then reenter page to start stream again (restart button)

Dial-in to meeting
- 2 minute timeout when using "Invite People" call-out function, plus an annoying notification
- Should use link or dial-in info: can this be recieved before starting call?
- This is useful for co-hosts/guests
- Are codes persistent across rooms? Or just meetings?

Recording
- Unclear whether stream is recording
- "Start recording" is for Dropbox saving
- "Start livestream" is separate from our start livestream button, but streams then saves to YouTube. Users need a Google account for this.
- 24 hold on new streaming accounts.
- Called YouTube Gaming (???)
- YouTube livestreams until all callers have hung up: have to kick all
- YouTube automatically posts as a public video unedited

Streaming
- Guests may prefer to dial-in
- Audience may not be clear on how to interact: No chats, hand raises
- Way to click from finished Jitsi call to YouTube stream page?

Layout:
- Jisti controls expand past viewport on bottom, try embed-responsive again
- Merchsidebar height still don't match player height
- No indication on ThinQ.tv that a stream is current on heroku
- Set join>hidden by default to avoid tiles filling the screen

Pre-call prep:
- Setup stream key
- Setup camera
- Choose moderator settings
- Give out phone number and room code to guests

Setting up next event:
- Went to Home page to view her upcoming events -- bad as heck if there's more than a few upcoming events. Users should have personal calendar on dashboard
- Real hard time converting timezone before creating event; needs to be based on user's computer timezone

Screen sharing
	- Very tiny window without collapsing tile sidebar; can we set to default collapsed
	- Clicking home after hanging up Livestream logged her out
	- Face + screen sharing not available
	- Room PIN is consistent over different streams! What a nice feature
	- Started screen share then started recording, may want to do opposite order to avoid recording setup
	- "Starting live stream" message on bottom unclear
	- Stream still works when window out-of-focus
	- Screen share has weird bottom border to keep aspect ratio, can ratio change depending on viewport size??
	- Viewport is still cutting off part of Jitsi
	- Recommend starting presentation with face then moving into screen share
	- Hide navbar when streaming?? Check how twitch handles this--probably unfixed header
	- Sidebar shows only one perk during a stream
	- Can stream another tab into Jitsi with extension
	- Using the app does NOT allow you to view stream
	- Jitsi has A SCHEDULED EVENTS feature
	- If streaming stops, recording continues and stops randomly I guess?
	- Popout version of video so you can do screen share as well?
	- Uses Discover Conversation Hosts to find profile.
	- Phone number is the same for any Meet, PIN is the same for any room

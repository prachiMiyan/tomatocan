User Experience Notes
========================================

October 23rd, 2018
Monica, testing livestream functionality before full conversation later in the week.
1. Originally was asked to go to crowdpublishtv.herokuapp.com, but wasn't sure how to spell Heroku. Not an easy URL.
2. Went to home page (ThinQ.tv)
3. Needed to scroll down to "Upcoming LIVE Conversations" table but thought she needed to click on "Discover Previous Conversations" in navbar
    - The home page isn't really meant for hosts to start their conversation from, but I guess that's the easiest way to find the table at the moment.
4. Clicked "Host a LIVE Conversations"
    - This
5. Not sure what time to put in to start a call immediately, ended up setting it for Saturday
    - Is there a way to allow impromptu streams?
6. Wanted to know if she could edit the event later
    - This should be made clearer in the event creation form.
7. Finished post and was taken back to home page
    - The Dashboard should be the hub for user activities on the site, so most actions should redirect to the Dashboard instead of Home.
8. Clicked her own name in home page Upcoming Conversations table
9. Opened her own Dashboard in a new tab. Very slow loading--possibly too strong of firewall at school network
    - Tile View button is not an obvious function
    - The host is currently just the first user in the room. Obvious potential for abuse here since they have Kick ability.
    - Can user tiles be hidden when video is turned off?
10. Monica asks if she should have Perks since her sidebar is empty.
11. Monica notes that she has not connected to Stripe because she doesn't feel invested enough yet.
12. Streamers unaware if text chat is sent unless they have chat sidebar opened.
    - This may need to prompt a notification of some kind?
    - Browser goes to top of page when a text chat is entered.
13. Call ended. Some sort of Stream Ended splash would be nice, but instead there's just a Jitsi rating.
